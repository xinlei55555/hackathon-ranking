      "Creating a dashboard and a report to visualize and communicate the market trends and opportunities for a fashion retailer.\n",
      "I have also participated in three previous hackathons, where I collaborated with other students to develop innovative solutions for real-world problems using market research methods and tools. For instance, in one hackathon, we used sentiment analysis and natural language processing to measure the emotional response of consumers to different types of advertisements. In another hackathon, we used machine learning and clustering to segment the customers of a grocery store based on their purchase behavior and preferences.\n",

      "Using web scraping and text analysis to see what consumers are saying about a movie on different websites and platforms.\n",
      "Making a poster and a video to show and explain the market size and potential for a new service for a social enterprise.\n",
      "I’ve also been to two other hackathons, where I worked with other awesome students to come up with creative solutions for real problems using market research skills and tools. For example, in one hackathon, we used eye tracking and facial recognition to test how consumers react to different packaging designs. In another hackathon, we used online surveys and experiments to find out how consumers respond to different pricing strategies.\n",

For instance, last summer I worked on a project to assess the market potential and consumer demand for a new smartwatch product. I conducted secondary research to analyze the market size, trends, and competitors, and primary research to collect data from potential customers using focus groups and online surveys. I then used various analytical methods to segment the market, identify the target audience, and evaluate their preferences and expectations. I also helped to create a report and a presentation to communicate the findings and recommendations to the client.\n",
